# CBMayhem Branch: 
This is sample FRC PowerUp code written using the cyborg FRC framework. The intent is to illustrate the use of cyborg. 

The robot this code ran on that consisted of a classic four motor six wheel kit chassis, with two cascaded, but independant lifts, each with its own motor, and finally a cube intake consisting of two sets of horizontal wheels driven by one motor per side. Each lift (main and intake) had its own encodder, and the main lift had a lower limit switch. The drivetrain had encoders on each side. There was also an available NavX IMU.
